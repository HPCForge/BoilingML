# Experiment configs:

Each subdirectory corresponds to a model. 

- `fno/` is for the Fourier Neural Operator 
- `uno/` is a U-shaped Fourier Neural Operator.
- `ffno/` is "Factorized Fourier Neural Operator"
- `gfno/` is for the Group-Equivarient Fourier Neural Operator
- `unet_bench` is the unet implementation from PDEBench
- `unet_arena` is the unet implementation from PDEArena
- `ufnet` is a version of unet that also uses some fourier layers.


The config files in each subdirectory correspond to different experiments.
