# BubbleML

A multi-physics dataset for scientific machine learning, optical flow, and segmentation. (Some sample videos producted with UNet can be seen in [videos](video/))

![SubCooled Temperature](video/subcooled.gif)

This can be used to train operator networks, act as a ground truth for Physics-Informed Neural Networks, or train computer vision models.
These models have applications to cooling systems for datacenters (I.e., liquid cooling flowing across a GPU) or even cooling nuclear reactors (I.e., a pool of liquid sitting on a heated surface).

## Dataset Downloads

The dataset is provided through AWS. Each boiling study can be installed separately.
