# Boiling

A multi-physics dataset for scientific machine learning, optical flow, and segmentation.

(Add a cool temperature video here :-))

This can be used to train operator networks, use as a ground truth for Physics-Informed Neural Networks, or train computer vision models.
These models have applications to cooling systems for datacenter cooling (I.e., liquid cooling flowing across a GPU) or even cooling nuclear reactors (I.e., a pool of liquid sitting on a heated surface).

## Usage

1. build conda environment
2. install PyTorch 2 using preferred method
